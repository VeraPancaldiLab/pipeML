\title{Plot Pooled AUROC and AUPRC Boxplots Across Multiple Folders}
\usage{
get_pooled_boxplots(folder_paths, file_name, width = 12, height = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{folder_paths}{Character vector. Paths to folders containing \code{.rds} files with ML model performance results.}

\item{file_name}{Character. Prefix for the saved PDF files containing the plots.}

\item{width}{Numeric. Width of the saved plots in inches. Default is 12.}

\item{height}{Numeric. Height of the saved plots in inches. Default is 8.}
}
\value{
Saves two PDF files in the \code{Results/} directory:
\itemize{
\item \code{Boxplots_AUROC_performance_<file_name>.pdf}
\item \code{Boxplots_AUPRC_performance_<file_name>.pdf}
}
No object is returned to the R environment.
}
\description{
This function aggregates AUROC and AUPRC metrics from multiple folders (typically corresponding to different cohorts or models),
and generates boxplots comparing model performance across groups.
}
\details{
Each \code{.rds} file is expected to contain a list object with a \code{result$AUC} element,
which includes numeric values for both \code{AUROC} and \code{AUPRC}.
Folder names are used as grouping labels in the plots.

Red dashed lines are drawn at a fixed reference value (e.g., 0.7) for visual interpretation.
