\title{Compute variable importance using SHAP values}
\usage{
compute_variable.importance(model, stacking = FALSE, n_cores = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A trained machine learning model.}

\item{stacking}{A logical value indicating whether the model was trained using stacking (default is FALSE).}

\item{n_cores}{An integer specifying the number of workers to use for parallel computation (default is 2).}
}
\value{
A data frame with SHAP values representing the variable importance for each feature.
}
\description{
Computes the variable importance for a machine learning model using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values.
}
\details{
If \code{stacking} is TRUE, the function computes the SHAP values for each base model in the stacked ensemble model and
averages them. If \code{stacking} is FALSE, the function computes the SHAP values for the provided single machine learning model.
The computed SHAP values are returned as a data frame with features as rows and samples as columns.
