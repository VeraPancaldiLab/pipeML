\title{Compute Cross-Validation Accuracy for ML Models}
\usage{
compute_cv_accuracy(
  models,
  file_name = NULL,
  base_models = FALSE,
  return = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{A named list of trained ML models, each with a \code{resample} element containing cross-validated accuracy.}

\item{file_name}{(Optional) Character string specifying the filename prefix for the saved accuracy plot (PDF format).}

\item{base_models}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the function selects and returns base models using \code{choose_base_models()} for stacking.}

\item{return}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the function saves a barplot of the model accuracy values in the \code{Results/} directory.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{Accuracy}: A data frame with the median and standard deviation of accuracy for each model.
\item \code{Top_model}: A character string naming the model with the highest median accuracy.
\item \code{Base_models} (optional): A character vector of selected base models if \code{base_models = TRUE}.
}
}
\description{
This function extracts cross-validated accuracy values from a list of trained machine learning models,
summarizes their median and standard deviation, and optionally plots a bar chart or selects base models for stacking.
}
\details{
This function assumes that each model in the list has a \code{$resample} component containing
a column named \code{Accuracy}. It calculates the median and standard deviation of accuracy
for each model and creates a barplot (if \code{return = TRUE}) with error bars.

If \code{base_models = TRUE}, it calls a helper function \code{choose_base_models()} to select
models for use in stacking.
