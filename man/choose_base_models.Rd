\title{Choose Top Base Models for Stacking Based on Accuracy or AUC Scores}
\usage{
choose_base_models(models, metric = "Accuracy")
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{A list of trained machine learning models. Each model must contain a \code{resample} data frame with
performance metrics (Accuracy, AUROC, AUPRC) from cross-validation.}

\item{metric}{A character string specifying the metric to use for model selection. Can be either "Accuracy", "AUROC", or "AUPRC".
Default is "Accuracy".}
}
\value{
A character vector containing the names of the top models selected based on the specified metric.
}
\description{
This function selects three base models for stacking based on either Accuracy or AUC metrics. It chooses the top models from
different categories (e.g., tree-based methods, linear models, instance-based methods) according to the specified metric.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
base_models = choose_base_models(models = ml_models, metric = "AUROC")
}
