\title{Plot SHAP values}
\usage{
plot_shap_values(shap_df, ml_model, file_name, width = 10, height = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{shap_df}{A data frame or matrix containing SHAP values where rows represent samples and columns represent features.}

\item{ml_model}{A character string representing the name of the machine learning model.}

\item{file_name}{A character string representing the name of the file to save the plot in the \verb{Results/} directory.}

\item{width}{A numeric value specifying the width of the plot in inches (default is 10).}

\item{height}{A numeric value specifying the height of the plot in inches (default is 10).}
}
\value{
A plot saved as a PDF file in the \verb{Results/} directory showing the variable importance of the machine learning model.
}
\description{
Plots the variable importance based on SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
and saves the plot to the \verb{Results/} directory.
}
\details{
This function generates a bar plot of the SHAP values, where the features are sorted by their mean SHAP value. The plot distinguishes
between features that increase the predicted outcome (colored in red) and those that decrease the predicted outcome (colored in blue).
The plot is saved as a PDF file in the \verb{Results/} directory, with the filename specified by the user.
