\title{Calculate recall values}
\usage{
calculate_recall(metrics, target)
}
\arguments{
\item{metrics}{A data frame with metrics obtained using \code{get_sensitivity_specificity()}, containing
at least two columns: "Sensitivity" and "Specificity".}

\item{target}{A character vector containing the true values from the target variable.
It should have the same length as the predictions.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector representing the recall values.
Recall is the fraction of actual positive instances that were correctly predicted.
}
\description{
This function calculates the recall (also known as sensitivity) of a model based on the provided metrics and the true target values.
Recall is defined as the ratio of true positive predictions to all actual positive instances (true positives + false negatives).
}
