\title{Compute Feature Selection Using Repeated Boruta Algorithm}
\usage{
feature.selection.boruta(
  data,
  iterations = NULL,
  fix,
  doParallel = F,
  workers = NULL,
  file_name = NULL,
  threshold = NULL,
  return
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with the column "target" (factor) as the response and other columns as features.}

\item{iterations}{Integer. The number of Boruta iterations to perform.}

\item{fix}{Logical. If TRUE, applies TentativeRoughFix() to resolve tentative features after each iteration.}

\item{doParallel}{Logical. Whether to use parallel processing.}

\item{workers}{Integer. Number of CPU cores to use for parallel execution. If NULL, uses all available cores minus one.}

\item{file_name}{A string for naming output plots and CSV files saved in the "Results/" directory.}

\item{threshold}{A numeric value between 0 and 1. A feature must be confirmed in more than \code{threshold * iterations} to be finally labeled as confirmed.}

\item{return}{Logical. Whether to save the resulting plots in the "Results/" directory.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item A vector of confirmed features.
\item A vector of tentative features.
\item A data frame with median importance values and final decisions.
}
}
\description{
Repeatedly applies the Boruta feature selection algorithm and aggregates results to determine consistently selected features.
