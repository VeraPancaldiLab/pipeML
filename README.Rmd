## Installation

You can install the development version of `pipeML` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("VeraPancaldiLab/pipeML")
```

## Description

pipeML is a robust R-based pipeline designed to streamline the training and testing of machine learning models for classification tasks. It is developed for fast, user-friendly deployment while maintaining the flexibility and complexity needed for rigorous, reliable implementation at every stage of the pipeline (Figure 1).

## General usage

These are basic examples which shows you how to use `pipeML` for different tasks. For a detailed tutorial, see [Get started](https://VeraPancaldiLab.github.io/pipeML/articles/pipeML.html)

``` r
library(pipeML)
```

The main function to compute the ML pipeline is through the `compute.ML` function.

```r
res_ml = compute.ML(raw.counts, normalized = T, clinical, trait = "Response",trait.positive = "CR", partition = 0.8, metric = "AUC", stack = T, feature.selection = F,seed = 1234, doParallel = T,  workers = 2, file_name = "Test", return = T)
```

The previous function is a one-partition run meaning it will partitionate your data into train and test once. For reproducibility, a seed needs to be specified. For a robust analysis we recommend testing performance from different partitions of train/test. For doing this users can use the `compute.bootstrap.ML` function:

```r
compute.bootstrap.ML(raw.counts, normalized = T, clinical, trait = "Response", trait.positive = "YES", partition = 0.8, metric = "Accuracy", iterations = 20, feature.selection = F, stack = T, workers = 4, file.name = "Test", return = F)
```

ML will be saved in your working directory inside a `Results` folder. In order to pool the performance across all models we provide the function `get_pooled_roc_curves` that allows you to plot a boxplot with the AUC-ROC and AUC-PRC scores across all your ML models.

```r
get_pooled_roc_curves("Test", "Results/ML_models") #Get boxplot with AUC scores distribution across iterations
```

pipeML provides also a function to perform the Leaving-One-Dataset-Out (LODO) approach.

```r
res_ml = compute.LODO.ML(raw.counts, normalized = T, clinical, trait = "Response",trait.positive = "R", trait.out = "Cohort", out = "Dupont", metric = "Accuracy", stack = T, feature.selection = F, doParallel = T, workers = 4, file_name = "Test", return = F)
```
